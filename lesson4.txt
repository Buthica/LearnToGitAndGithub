Branch & Merge
$git branch <branchName>
$git branch - check current branch
$git checkout <branchName> - to select branch
**Merge branch

_first: We need to think about what branch you want to merge.
##Example: we choose **apple** branch
_second: We go back to master branch and merge apple branch to our current branch.
$git merge apple
&&&&**----> 
$git commit -m "c1"
$git branch "apple"
$git checkout apple
$git commit -m "c2"
$git checkout master
$git commit -m "c3"
$git merge apple
